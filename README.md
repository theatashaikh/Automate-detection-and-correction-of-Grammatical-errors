# Automate-detection-and-correction-of-Grammatical-errors

The following project is an Automatic Grammatical error detection and correction deep learning model. I begin with installing libraries such as spacy, happytransformers and transformers. I used JFLEG dataset which is considered the golden standard for GEC. Afterwards I preprocessed the text and did some text analysis using wordcloud.


## Introduction and Objectives

This is TCS iON-RIO 125 Industry Project. This project is basically detection and correction of English grammatical mistakes. It is based on Natural Language Processing. Natural Language Processing is defined as base for understanding Human language by Computer using Machine Learning and Neural Networks. The following are the examples of NLP: Translation, Grammatical error correction, Text generation, etc. I have chosen the Deep Learning Project on Automate Detection and Recognition of Grammatical Errors. In this project, I have to create a model that should detects the grammatical errors in the given sentences which is in English language. The project includes data pre-processing, analyses of data, splitting of train and train data and creation of model.

The Objective of this project is to create a Deep learning model that can successfully detects and corrects Grammatical mistakes in the sentences and Highlights the incorrect words in red color and after correction replace it with green color.


## Solution Approach

A Grammatical error detection and correction problem is basically a type of text-based sequence to sequence problem. For a text-based problem most suited algorithm is Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). 


To implement my project I used JFLEG dataset, Google Colab, Spacy, Jupyter Notebook, word cloud, transformers, T5 model and python programming language.


## Exceptions

1)	The model assumes a certain level of contextual understanding. It may struggle with sentences that require extensive world knowledge or domain-specific information beyond what is present in the training data
2)	The effectiveness of the model depends on the quality and diversity of the training data. If the training data does not adequately cover the range of grammatical errors present in real-world text, the model's performance may be limited.
3)	The corrected sentences generated by the model are assumed to be in English and in a readable, coherent format. The model may not provide accurate corrections for sentences with ambiguous context.
4)	The model might tend to overcorrect, making unnecessary changes to grammatically correct sentences. This can result in introduced errors or changes in the intended meaning of the text.
5)	Deep learning models, including T5, are often considered as "black boxes" in the sense that it can be challenging to interpret or explain their decision-making processes. This lack of interpretability may be a drawback in scenarios where understanding the reasoning behind corrections is important.

## Enhancement

The enhancement scope of this project are follows:
1)	In future we can use this algorithm with more than one particular language.
2)	Enhance the model's ability to understand and maintain context over longer passages. This can involve exploring more advanced architectures, such as models with longer context windows, or incorporating mechanisms that focus on capturing contextual dependencies.
3)	Integrate explainability features to provide users with insights into why a particular correction was suggested. This can enhance user trust and understanding of the model's decision-making process.
4)	Implement a user feedback loop to gather corrections or feedback on the model's suggestions. This data can be used to fine-tune the model further, addressing specific cases where the model might struggle.
